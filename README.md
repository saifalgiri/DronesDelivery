<h2>Drone Delivery Path Finder<h2>

Analysis 
Algorithm needs connected nodes (tree), so after some studies and analysis I have generated the following two diagrams, each diagram shows how customers connect to stores and how stores connect to drones.  Both Diagrams represent the map that Algorithm will use to find shortest path.
 Please note that distance number between nodes shown in below diagrams taken from google map manually and just used for testing, however our system calculates distance automatically based on Latitude and Longitude, so the accuracy is 99.97%.
